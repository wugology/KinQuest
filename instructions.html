The scope of this database is restricted to kinship terms not address terms (i.e. father not dad, grandmother not grandma). Please keep this in mind when contributing your data.
<br><br>
In this survey, we seek to answer the following questions:
<ol>
<li>how are families, clans or other social groups organized?</li>
<li>what are the exact features that define each type of relationship?</li>
<li>what are the words used to name these relationships?</li>
</ol>

We address this first question by offering you a template or blank space to organize your relations. In both options, a series of boxes are presented around a central "ego". The boxes can represent canonical immediate relations (parents, siblings, children, etc.) or more culturally-specific distinctions (marriageable, spiritual, etc.). Each relation should be labeled in terms of the central "ego" person. By default, the central "ego" is gender neutral. If it matters whether or not the central "ego" is male or female, you may use additional "ego" spaces.
<br><br>
To address the second question, we offer you a list of relations in the right-hand column. Some of these relations are pre-defined with features that are common cross-linguistically (e.g. male, biologically-related parent [father]) but all relations are customizable - you may add or delete any features that are distinguished in your language. Drag these relation icons into the appropriate box around the central "ego" and make sure that all the distinguishing features are checked.
<br><br>
Finally, once you have dragged the relation icon from the right-hand column into one of the relationship boxes around the central "ego", you will be asked to label that relation. Please use the standard, most-commonly used name for this relation. If there are other terms, include these in the box marked "other terms".
<br><br>
Once you have added an immediate relation, you will then be able to add secondary relations through that relation (e.g. female, biologically-related parent of female, biologically-related parent [grandmother]). This is done in the feature list by selecting the relation that you have already dragged into your relationship space.
